# DocumentationCommentsGenerator
A Visual Studio extension for generating C# documentation comments.

This is the replacement project for the GenerateDocumentationComments project. A number of problems were discovered with the
GenerateDocumentationComments project that could only be solved by a major redesign. The DocumentationCommentsGenerator
project is the result of that redesign.

At this time. you should read the Readme.md file from that project and assume it applies to this project unless stated
otherwise below.

Boilerplate summary documentation comments are added to public, protected, and internal class declarations
when the Tools->Invoke DocumentationCommentsGenerator menu item is selected.
